# University-Management-Website-
Our main goal was to make a system which would incorporate all the necessary functions that a university website should have at present time. It would make efficient use of technology to serve students, faculties and other stakeholders of the university. Designing a system which would manage all the university components at one place can help maintain efficient communication between different user levels. We have developed online services which would help students and faculties stay updated about various matters concerning the institution. For prospective students, we designed an Automated Educational Counselor which can be a source of information regarding subject selection at university level. Thus, our proposed system can be very resourceful and a central ground of information for all mentioned users of a university.
